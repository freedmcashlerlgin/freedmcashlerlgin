freedom cash lenders login offers personal loans with a minimum credit score requirement of 550. This alone makes it an ideal alternative for those with bad credit. Loan amounts range from $2,000 to $35,000, and borrowers can choose a repayment term between one and five years. 

On the downside, the lender does have a higher interest rate cap and doesn’t offer joint loans, so if you have poor credit, you may end up with a hefty rate. Besides that, freedom cash lenders login loans aren’t available in every state, so you’ll need to make sure yours is serviced before applying.
