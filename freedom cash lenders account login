Student loans were a big part of how I was able to have college experiences that I wouldn't have had otherwise, particularly a life-changing experience studying abroad in London for four months in my junior year. I used a mix of Pell grants, student loans, scholarships and jobs to pay for school, saving tens of thousands of dollars and helping me pay off my student loans within a year of graduation. I encourage students to look at all their resources and creative ways to achieve their goals in school and set themselves up for financial success.
